Major star systems are advanced. They export:
  * technology (electronics, tools, processors)
  * luxuries (art, food, entertainment, "entertainment")

Minor stars are not as developed, and often consist of a space based mining operation, and a planet side organic harvesting colony (farming, fishing, etc.). Because of the seasonal nature of the organic harvesting, people will often work in mining during when not needed on the planet, leading to increased production from the mine in the organic off season.
